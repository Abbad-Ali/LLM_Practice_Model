# Spam Classification with Machine Learning

This project involves classifying emails as spam or ham (non-spam) using machine learning techniques. The notebook performs data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification using Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms.

## Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Loads the dataset from a CSV file.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the email text.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Converts text into numerical features using Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF methods.
4. **Model Training**: Trains Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the models' performance using accuracy scores.
